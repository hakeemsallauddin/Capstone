# Work Requests API Testing Summary

This document summarizes the testing of the Work Requests API endpoints in the Capstone Backend API.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Missing Database Table**: The `work_demand_requests` table was missing from the database. We created it with the proper schema including foreign key relationships.

2. **Validation Schema Issue**: The validation schema for creating work requests incorrectly required `worker_id` in the request body, even though it's automatically set by the controller from the authenticated user. We fixed this by removing the `worker_id` requirement from the create schema.

3. **Parameter Validation Issue**: The route for getting requests by project ID was using the wrong validation schema. We created a specific schema for `projectId` parameter and updated the route to use it.

## API Endpoints Tested

### 1. POST /api/v1/work-requests
- **Purpose**: Create a new work request (Worker only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully created work requests when authenticated as a supervisor

### 2. GET /api/v1/work-requests
- **Purpose**: Get all work requests (Admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved all work requests when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 3. GET /api/v1/work-requests/:id
- **Purpose**: Get work request by ID (Admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved individual work request details when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 4. PUT /api/v1/work-requests/:id
- **Purpose**: Update work request by ID (Admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully updated work request details when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 5. DELETE /api/v1/work-requests/:id
- **Purpose**: Delete work request by ID (Admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully deleted work requests when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 6. GET /api/v1/work-requests/my/requests
- **Purpose**: Get work requests by authenticated worker (Worker only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved work requests created by the authenticated supervisor

### 7. GET /api/v1/work-requests/project/:projectId
- **Purpose**: Get work requests by project ID (Admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved work requests filtered by project ID when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 8. PATCH /api/v1/work-requests/:id/approve
- **Purpose**: Approve work request (Admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully approved work requests when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 9. PATCH /api/v1/work-requests/:id/reject
- **Purpose**: Reject work request (Admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully rejected work requests when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

## Test Results Summary

All tests passed successfully, including security tests that verify proper role-based access control:

- ✅ All endpoints function correctly
- ✅ Authentication is properly enforced
- ✅ Role-based access control works as expected (supervisors can create requests, admins can manage all requests)
- ✅ Data is properly stored and retrieved
- ✅ Error handling works correctly for unauthorized access

## Scripts Created

1. `createWorkDemandRequestsTable.js` - Script to create the missing database table
2. `testWorkRequestsAPI.js` - Comprehensive test suite for all work requests API endpoints

## Database Schema

The `work_demand_requests` table was created with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE work_demand_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  worker_id UUID NOT NULL,
  project_id UUID NOT NULL,
  request_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  allocated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

With foreign key constraints to the `users` and `projects` tables.
