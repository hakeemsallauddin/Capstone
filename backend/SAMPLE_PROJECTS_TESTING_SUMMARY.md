# Sample Projects Testing Summary

This document summarizes the creation of sample data and testing of the Project API endpoints in the Capstone Backend API.

## Sample Data Created

We created 5 sample projects with different statuses to thoroughly test the API:

1. **Road Construction Project**
   - Status: pending
   - Worker need: 50
   - Duration: 2025-10-01 to 2026-03-31

2. **Water Pipeline Installation**
   - Status: pending
   - Worker need: 30
   - Duration: 2025-11-15 to 2026-02-28

3. **School Building Renovation**
   - Status: active
   - Worker need: 20
   - Duration: 2025-09-01 to 2025-12-31

4. **Health Center Construction**
   - Status: active
   - Worker need: 40
   - Duration: 2025-08-01 to 2026-01-31

5. **Solar Panel Installation**
   - Status: completed
   - Worker need: 15
   - Duration: 2025-07-01 to 2025-09-30

## API Endpoints Tested

### 1. GET /api/v1/projects
- **Purpose**: Get all projects
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved all 10 projects

### 2. GET /api/v1/projects/:id
- **Purpose**: Get project by ID
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved individual project details

### 3. POST /api/v1/projects
- **Purpose**: Create a new project
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully created new projects when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 4. PUT /api/v1/projects/:id
- **Purpose**: Update project by ID
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully updated project details when authenticated as admin

### 5. DELETE /api/v1/projects/:id
- **Purpose**: Delete project by ID
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully deleted projects when authenticated as admin

### 6. GET /api/v1/projects/my/projects
- **Purpose**: Get projects created by authenticated user
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved projects created by the admin user

### 7. GET /api/v1/projects/status/:status
- **Purpose**: Get projects by status
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully filtered projects by status:
  - 5 pending projects
  - 4 active projects
  - 2 completed projects

## Test Results Summary

All tests passed successfully, including security tests that verify proper role-based access control:

- ✅ All endpoints function correctly with sample data
- ✅ Authentication is properly enforced
- ✅ Role-based access control works as expected (only admins can create/update/delete projects)
- ✅ Data filtering by status works correctly
- ✅ Error handling works properly for unauthorized access

## Scripts Created

Three scripts were created to facilitate testing:

1. `createSampleProjects.js` - Creates sample project data
2. `testProjectsWithSampleData.js` - Comprehensive tests of all endpoints with sample data
3. `testProjectAPI.js` - Original test suite for basic functionality

## Sample Data Verification

After running the scripts, the database contains:
- 10 total projects (5 from initial sample data + 5 from testing)
- Projects in all three statuses (pending, active, completed)
- Proper relationships with admin user as creator
