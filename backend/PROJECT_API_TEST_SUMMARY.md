# Project API Test Summary

This document summarizes the testing of the Project API endpoints in the Capstone Backend API.

## Issue Identified

The database was missing the `projects` table, which was required for the Project API endpoints to function. We created the table with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  location VARCHAR(255),
  worker_need INTEGER NOT NULL,
  start_date DATE NOT NULL,
  end_date DATE NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_by UUID NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## API Endpoints Tested

### 1. GET /api/v1/projects
- **Purpose**: Get all projects
- **Authentication**: Required (any authenticated user)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved all projects

### 2. GET /api/v1/projects/:id
- **Purpose**: Get project by ID
- **Authentication**: Required (any authenticated user)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved project by ID

### 3. POST /api/v1/projects
- **Purpose**: Create a new project
- **Authentication**: Required (admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully created project when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 4. PUT /api/v1/projects/:id
- **Purpose**: Update project by ID
- **Authentication**: Required (admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully updated project when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 5. DELETE /api/v1/projects/:id
- **Purpose**: Delete project by ID
- **Authentication**: Required (admin only)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully deleted project when authenticated as admin
- **Security**: ✅ Correctly denied access to non-admin users

### 6. GET /api/v1/projects/my/projects
- **Purpose**: Get projects created by authenticated user
- **Authentication**: Required (any authenticated user)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved projects created by the authenticated user

### 7. GET /api/v1/projects/status/:status
- **Purpose**: Get projects by status
- **Authentication**: Required (any authenticated user)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved projects filtered by status

## Test Results Summary

All tests passed successfully, including security tests that verify proper role-based access control:

- ✅ All endpoints function correctly
- ✅ Authentication is properly enforced
- ✅ Role-based access control works as expected (only admins can create/update/delete projects)
- ✅ Data is properly retrieved and filtered
- ✅ Error handling works correctly

## Test Script

The test script `testProjectAPI.js` includes comprehensive tests for all endpoints with both positive and negative test cases, including security validation.
